# Week 9
*13 September 2016*



## PCA-SVM Occupancy Sensing
### Sensing accuracy

UPDATE 15/9. Calculate tp, fp, tn, fn on the 1 month training and 1 week testing scenario. We found that:
1. When training is done using June data, 90% of errors are caused by false positives
2. When training is done using August data, 90% of errors are caused by false negatives
3. When training is done using July data, 95% of errors are caused by false positives

Trying to improve accuracy graph by:<br>
1. [Use more training data than testing data (20:80 or 10:90 rule)](#twentyeighty)<br>
2. [Work only with weekdays data](#weekdays)<br> 
3. [Work only with weekends data](#weekends)<br>
4. [Train with 1 month data, test on 1 week data](#onemonth)<br>

All results are obtained with 10 fold cross validation.

## NILMTK
Comparing the result metrics (FTE, Te, and Ja)  of Original CO, CO centroid, CO Centroid + Priority, Original CO+Priority  between All Appliances and Top-5 Appliances
### Summary
####1.There is a significant improvement  for Top 5 FTE, using a new FTE compared to original FTE <br>
(Train :  10-11 June 2012, Test : 11-12 June 2012)<br>
a. Original CO (56.16%) <br>
b. CO Centorid (27.7%)<br>
c. CO Centroid + Priority (27.90%) <br>
(Train :  10-11 June 2012, Test : 12-13 June 2012) <br>
a. Original CO (98.2%) <br>
b. CO Centorid (23.68%) <br>
c. CO Centroid + Priority (22.77%) <br>
