## Dataset

According to the NILMTK [[1](#nilmtk)], they used 8 type of dataset for NILMTK. For the initial exploration of NILTMK, **iAWE** dataset is used,  the all list of the dataset shown below :  

1. REDD : We cannot use this dataset because it needs account from the owner (send an email to : kolter@csail.mit.edu and mattjj@csail.mit.edu), We have sent an email. However, they have not replied our request. Link to download : http://redd.csail.mit.edu/

2. UK-Dale : We can access the link for UK-Dale dataset, but after downloading the dataset, the file is empty, so we cannot use this dataset for exploring NILMTK. Link to download : http://data.ukedc.rl.ac.uk/simplebrowse/edc/efficiency/residential/EnergyConsumption/Domestic/UK-DALE-2015

3. BLUED : We can access and download BLUED dataset, for the initial exploration of NILMTK, we will use Dataset 001. Link to download :  http://portoalegre.andrew.cmu.edu:88/BLUED/

4. Smart* : We can access and download Smart dataset.  Link to download :  http://traces.cs.umass.edu/index.php/Smart/Smart

5. Tracebase  : We can access and download Smart dataset.  Link to download :  https://www.tracebase.org/download/

6. AMPds  : We can access and download Smart dataset.  Link to download :  http://ampds.org/

7. iAWE  : We can access and download Smart dataset. .  Link to download :  http://iawe.github.io/

8. Peacan : Peacan dataset needs registration and payment.  Link to download: http://www.pecanstreet.org/pecan-street-research-institute-data-set-download/

We have saved and put the dataset for BLUED, Smart*, Tracebase, and AMPds, and iAWE in our dropbox (https://www.dropbox.com/home/MDDP/NILMTK/dataset)
