# ADEM (Adaptive Energy Information Management System)

ADEM is an open-source research and development project focused on **Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM)**. The system aims to provide an adaptive framework for managing energy information, specifically by disaggregating total household energy consumption into individual appliance usage patterns.

This repository leverages [NILMTK](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/nilmtk/nilmtk) to analyze various energy datasets and evaluate load monitoring algorithms.
